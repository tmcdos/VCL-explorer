# VCL-explorer

This small tool loads the chosen BPL (compiled by Delphi) and lists all exported classes. For each class it then shows:
- virtual methods by their index
- dynamic methods by their 16-bit identifier
- implemented interfaces and their methods

There is also quick-search (filtration) and the results of the reverse-engineering can be exported/imported.
